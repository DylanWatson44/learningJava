1.To find the team names, we'll create an arraylist and use the scanner tool to scan the first line
and assign this to a string array list. Then the next scan line will be assigned to a coach list,
and the line after that gets stored as the number of players. This is important, as it defines how
many times we have to loop through assigning the next 3 lines to each player on that team, stopping
just in time to take the next line after as the next team and repeating the process. We'll need a list
of players and coachs, and to assign a player list to each team object.
